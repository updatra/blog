Congrats, you have built something awesome. People are signing up and using your application. After talking with a few of your users, you have learned their desire for a new feature and are now updating your app. How do you let your users know?

> Do you email everyone? Do you have a banner message on your dashboard? Do you not say anything and let you users figure it out?

It’s a hard problem. In my startups I have experienced first hand how difficult it is to communicate with users. We have tried multiple tools: Mixpanel, Mailing Lists and Intercom; yet none of them facilitated easy communication and forced us to either send an email or show a huge pop-up to our users. I just wanted to communicate with my users, letting them know about updates either large or small.

*Building this tool isn’t a core feature of our business.* All of our hard work of creating the awesome integration were fizzled by the fact that users either didn’t know about the feature or were annoyed that they were spammed with an email about this update that wasn’t quite relevant to them. Most of the time we ended up not telling our users, and continued to focus on making our product better. We needed a better solution.

Enter Updatra, a product that makes it easy to keep users in the loop. It is still in development, but the concept is clear: Easy communication with your users through in app notifications and intelligent follow-ups. With Updatra, each user will have a personalized update list, only showing notifications they haven’t seen. If a user hasn’t seen an important update, Updatra will automatically follow up with an email to let them know. No more double notifications or mass emails. Intelligently communicate with your users.

There is a lot more to come and I’m excited to bring [Updatra](http://www.updatra.com) to the world. Please take a look at Updatra, share some feedback with me and sign up for updates.
