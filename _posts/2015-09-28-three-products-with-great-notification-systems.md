Notifications are the easiest way to increase your users engagement and communicate important information to your users. Even with the best design in the world, forcing a user to remember to anything is a fool's errand. Delivering important information is an easy way to engage with you users and ensure that they have the information they need to excel. Users feel extremely empowered when they know exactly what is going on, and making it easy for users to find this information is critical.

I’m going to highlight three awesome applications and how their notifications make their apps highly engaging. So, without further ado here are three great products and their killer notifications systems:

#Facebook
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) is the gold standard for notifications and their notification center. As you probably know, their notifications are always present within the user interface and proudly display the items that you may find interesting or require your attention. This consistent place where notifications can be found creates a habit for Facebook users and allows a user to always find the information they need without any thought. Simply keeping all your notifications together and in one place is the easiest first step to a notification center.

Facebook Notifications are also a central place for all of your notifications. Facebook is a large application spanning dozens of products, but there is only one place for notifications. Facebook Pages, Ads, Groups, Games and Personal notifications are all delivered to the same list. There is no need to have the user jump around to different places and force them to remember to check Facebook’s different products.  Having all the different information in one place only deepens the habit of coming back to Facebook every day.

Bonus: Facebook will send emails if you don’t see a given notification with the interface. I have found that Facebook will wait about 36 hours before sending the email but Facebook wants to make sure you, as the user, will see the piece of information.

#AirBNB
[AirBNB’s](https://www.airbnb.com/) notifications are all about conversations and reservations. As an application, they need to make sure that information is delivered fast and is received by either the host or guest. Especially as reservations aren’t an instant process, the conversation process needs to go smoothly to ensure the reservation is placed.

The most unique and interesting part of the AirBNB notification system is their use of Text Messages(SMS). Every message and notification received is also delivered as a text message. This medium plays well into a product like AirBNB considering that the user may be traveling and not be able to access the internet. One downside of their system is that is rather annoying when you are at a computer, Especially when traveling abroad, the text message is a great way to get information and respond back and that is why I won’t turn off the SMS notification. 

#Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) nails the cross platform problem. Especially when you have the Slack application installed on multiple devices and the quantity of notifications that you will receive(chat apps have a ton of notifications), Slack wants to make sure that they deliver the notification to the right place.  Slack knows what platform you are on currently, delivers the notification there. 

Not only do they make sure to deliver notifications to your current active device, but they will send that notification to the other platforms if you don’t see it on the last active device. Take this example, you are in a chat with a colleague about an important meeting on your laptop. You head to the meeting and leave your computer on. Your colleague then sends an important update you NEED to know for your meeting. Slack is smart enough to know after a few minutes you may not be at your computer so it propagates that notification to your phone. Information delivered and you can go into your meeting in the know. This notification delivery allows a user to trust Slack with their communication and doesn’t force user to use other systems to send messages. 

---------------------------------------

All of these Products deliver different value, but all use notifications to communicate important information to the user and keep engagement high. Making sure each user knows everything they need to will ensure users are in the know, happy and coming back to your product day after day.
