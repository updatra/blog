As much as you hope bad things never happens, at some point during the growth of your business you will have to deliver bad news to your users. Hopefully it won’t happen *knock on wood* but when it does you should make sure to handle it properly. If you don’t, you will lose customers faster than you can ever imagine. Following a few simple guidelines you can make sure to reduce the pain your users feel and almost turn bad news into a good thing. 

#Step 1. Report Fast

It’s simple, make sure to detect the issue and communicate quickly. The goal should be to keep reaction time to under 15 minutes. Make sure to let your users know something is going on because chances are, they will be feeling the issue. If you don’t know what is happen, let your users know that you are investing the issue. Heroku does this quite often, the first report of problems look like this: “We're investigating an increased rate of API errors.”. Even though this descriptive, it lets the users know that something is going on so they don’t get frustrated.

#Step 2. Be Visible

Make sure your users see any messaging your publishing. If nobody sees your updates, then they might as not send them at all. For technical products, status pages have become a standard, made even better by the folks at statuspage.io. For everyone else, I recommend delivering notifications directly within the application. For example, If a file uploader is broken let them know before they try and fail to upload a file. The goal is to ensure they know the issue before your user gets frustrated.

#Step 3. Provide Resolution

At the end of any incident, provide a very clear and definite resolution. Assure your users that everything is back to normal and that you will be taking steps forward to ensure it doesn’t happen again. Provide enough information to satisfy the user's curiosity. By letting the user know what happened, you can install the confidence that it won’t happen again. 

Extending Step 2, make sure that your users see this resolution. If a user sees the error, they need to know that there is some resolution to the problem. A classic problem for mobile apps, apps that crash and don’t have an update ready will likely get uninstalled. Make sure that the resolution gets relayed to the user before you lose them. This means deliver the notification to their inbox, as they won’t be able to see it in-app and chance are they won’t be checking for the latest update in the app store.  Make sure to get this message delivered to them.
